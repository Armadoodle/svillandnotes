- [The party opens up mid-shitshow](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4). [[Gudrick]]  has booked it. [[Obby]]  has just used denying strike to prevent [[Vjenga]] from attacking [[Gudrick]] . She instead tries to grab [[Obby]] , but the poptart is too slick. [[Eikthyr]]  and [[Sylvi]]  continue whapping her. [[Venphira]]  still appears [[amber]]  and is unconscious on the ground behind everyone else.
    
- [[Vjenga]] wigs out (running theme). Cries out in giant to insist that the party stop [[Gudrick]]  before he leaves. Raves about [[Venphira]]  [[amber]] . 
    
- [[Obby]]  tries to reach out to [[Vjenga]]and tell her they can't kill [[Gudrick]]  right here. If she goes out, she'll die. He reminds her that [[Venphira]]  needs her. He tells [[Sylvi]]  to stop attacking and sheaths his sword. gets on her level.
    

- rolls to persuade [[Sylvi]] . Not effective. She's scared of [[Vjenga]]and doesn't trust her
    
- Shoves [[Sylvi]] . Not effective 
    

- [[Vjenga]] understands [[Obby]]  but isn’t on the same page as he is. She continues to respond in giant, screams that [[Gudrick]]  will let [[Fenrir]]  out on the people if he is permitted to leave alive.
    
- [[Gudrick]]  does some shit outside on the DL.
    

- Outside is getting hot, so says [[Loki]]. He suggests that we should maybe get out of here.
    
- [[Vjenga]] tries to get out, convinced of the pursuit of [[Gudrick]] . She busts a hole in the first of two doors but doesn’t get all the way out.
    
- [[Obby]]  continues to insist that [[Gudrick]]  dying right now would be bad news. 
    
- [[Vjenga]] abbreviates her crazy push through the door to insist that [[Obby]]  goes out, if she can’t. Someone has to keep him from leaving! [[Loki]] translates that.
    
-  [[Obby]]  runs out and leaves behind the twilight edge, which is a tactical choice and probably a wise one. As soon as he pushes out of the second door, he sees an enormous crowd (elyes says 100s) of mixed nation guards. He shouts at them bearstyle to move, and they part enough that he can get through. 
    

- [[Obby]]  retroactively gives [[Loki]] a Blackberry sending stone. 
    

- [[Obby]]  looks for the queen, he sees her and could reach her next turn. The queen seems to know that something has gone wrong. 
    

- On the way, he shouts, specifically:
    

- “[[Gudrick]]  will unleash [[Fenrir]] , and betray us”
    
- Pretty persuasive! People start freaking out, some slow [[Gudrick]] ’s escape.
    

- Meanwhile [[Venphira]]  has a wet dream. 
    

- She’s back on [[Nidhogg]] Beach. It stinks like Icky corpses.
    
- As she draws closer to the [[Nidhogg]] cage, it initially looks empty. Then it grabs her again. Time is a flat circle.](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=sU5SWXXqDXlVauCn&t=5574) 
    
- [[Nidhogg]] appears to have partially wiggled out on their own. Half out?
    
- The [[Nidhogg]] roasts her
    

- asks her if she’d like to have the power to save her friends or die here with them?
    
- Ven asks whether she’ll have the power to protect them later if they protect them now. 
    
- The [[Nidhogg]] says that they keep their word (unlike her).
    
- [[Nidhogg]] expresses a desire to play on the playground.](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=1lnGRUj8_61ez1X_&t=5709) Plus ur not in a position to bargain. “It’s me or death” said the manipulative dragon girlfriend.
    
- Ven has additional terms: no harm will come to the people she cares about.
    
- The [[Nidhogg]] reluctantly agrees after they are given this ultimatum, but tells [[Venphira]]  that they will ensure she and everyone she cares about winds up at [[Nastrond]]. This does qualify as harm i think
    

- They drop [[Venphira]] , she wakes up on impact.
    
- “Did you accept?”
    
- “I don’t know” Dude honestly if i were the [[Nidhogg]] i would give up and find literally any other manipulatable bastard on svilland because [[Venphira]]  has negative commitment. [[Nidhogg]] genuinely you’ve done more for yourself on your own without her. Boons last as long as [[Venphira]]  intends to set [[Nidhogg]] free (how do we know her intentions?) Do you really think you’re getting out, [[Nidhogg]]? U think Ven will put in the work? Did she pick an evocation???
    
- “I accepted”
    
- Ven gets eldritch adept feat and can automatically succeed one divine intervention a week via the [[Nidhogg]]. There are unclear additional repercussions. The terms of agreement these two have is held together with wet toilet paper. 
    
- Ven wakes up and sees everything that’s going on, [[Vjenga]] is eyeballing her suspiciously. Ven vibe checks the room. Max’s boss calls them and we all piss. 
    

- [[Cecil]] wakes up to someone knocking at the door.
    

- I meet someone. I am not cheesed to meet them. I detonate the charges. I flee the scene. 
    
- [[Cecil]] starts a fire and escapes out a window. 
    
- The defenses of the mountain begin to activate
    

- Back in the temple, [[Vjenga]] grabs [[Venphira]] , under the impression that she is infected and dangerous. [[Vjenga]] howls and howls about how [[Gudrick]]  can’t leave, and tries to push through the rest of the door, unsuccessfully. The volume of her screech reaches out into the crowd and scares some folks silly. 
    
- [[Obby]]  updates the [[Loki]] about what’s going on outside.
    

- He also talks to the queen, and tells her the same thing he’s been proclaiming to the party. 
    
- [What evidence do we have?](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=7qc2qauP8ZCX9LRv&t=9214)
    
- [Um he told us.](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=7qc2qauP8ZCX9LRv&t=9214) 
    
- Another amazing persuasion roll from the Block
    
- [[Bergljot]] begins approaching [[Gudrick]]  to apprehend him.
    
- [[Obby]]  tries to quell the panic outside. 
    

- [[Sylvi]]  heals [[Vjenga]], and immediately regrets it as [[Vjenga]] straightens up. 
    
- [[Venphira]]  tries to cast slumber from [[Vjenga]]’s grip. She saves, nothing happens. She tries to touch and console [[Vjenga]], telling her “it's okay”. She still looks like she’s [[amber]] -ed, which freaks [[Vjenga]] out just as much as it consoles ehr. 
    
- The mountain’s defenses fully activate and a spectral DUDE pops out and begins scanning the area for threats. 
    
- [[Loki]] throws a dagger at [[Vjenga]] and she is knocked unconscious, falls outta her form, and collapses in a pile of blue fleshy goo on [[Venphira]] . 
    

- [[Loki]] stops time, runs out and ties up [[Gudrick]]  in a building. In the process, he procs the LOOKER, who follows him visually to the building where he has dropped his quarry. Sits on him. The big guard thing is approaching him. 
    
- Queen is probably very confused. 
    

- [[Vjenga]] death save 
    
- [[Obby]]  runs to the Queen to update her on the [[Gudrick]]  situation. He asks if she needs a boost, but she has bug legs and can do things herself. She gets on a roof and begins getting things under order. 
    

- [[Loki]] hands off [[Gudrick]]  to [[Obby]]  and then books it. [[Gudrick]]  is tied up and gagged Ulfric Stormcloak style. 
    

- [[Sylvi]]  heals [[Vjenga]]. Not super happy about the recent events. Sorry baby girl I didn’t mean to scare u. 
    
- Some guards bust into the temple where the girly poops are. 
    
- [[Venphira]]  also heals [[Vjenga]]
    
- [[Loki]] tries to kite the big boss away. It won’t end well for him.
    
- On [[Vjenga]]’s turn she apologizes to [[Sylvi]]  and [[Venphira]]  and tries to touch them both. [[Sylvi]]  flinches away and [[Venphira]]  is WEIRD AND SCALY! ONE EYE IS HOGGED OUT! She yoinks [[Venphira]]  up to her feet.

- The guards tell the girly poops not to leave and to cooperate, but they’re frightened. [[Vjenga]] apprehensively asks where [[Gudrick]]  is, confirming the guard’s suspicion of a murderous attempt.
    
- They escort the party to another area. The queen watches them go but does nothing. 
    
- [[Obby]]  concludes, looking at the big protector thing, that the ray is truesight. 
    

- The construct apprehends [[Loki]] offscreen. 
    
- [[Obby]]  tries to call him and gets no response on the blackberry. 
    

- [[Aleson the Arisen]] walks by. Wetly. 
    

- His homeboy speaks for him to the people around.
    

- [[Obby]]  shouts the Queen over, who comes in upside down through the window.
    

- [[Obby]]  asks if she can send the delibs over. 
    
- No, bc they are being arrested. [The queen will take [[Gudrick]]  with her and put him in a separate place to the delibbies.](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=Mg4Z038xZZqpkx_U&t=13355) [[Obby]]  asks if he’s under arrest. It doesn't seem like it. She tells him to instead investigate the explosion 
    

- She’s mad at me :’y
    

- [[Cecil]] sees [[Obby]]  as he makes his way over, waves him down. 
    

- [[Cecil]] explains what happened. Vaguely. No time to unpack dat Goku. At least the fire is out. 
    
- [[Obby]]  updates [[Cecil]] on the sitch. They “jokingly” suggest blowing up the courthouse. 
    
- [Guards come out and talk to [[Obby]] . [[Cecil]] gets wigs.](https://www.youtube.com/live/oBVHg0XXcp4?si=aOkrEi5WiRNltmpL&t=14037) 
    

- [[Cecil]] says that this isn’t [[Obby]]ren, but “B[[Obby]]  Anne”
    
- They ask if [[Cecil]] is [[Cecil]].
    

- No 
    
- Flash of Genius 
    
- NO!
    
- It’s “[[Cecil]] (seesill) Booby”
    
- Common mistake. 
    
- My apologies. They want to find [[Cecil]] to detain and ask questions about the Libs. [[Cecil]] sees another Yuan Ti that bears striking resemblance to [[Ana Bui]], and then walks off. 
    
- ?
    
- QUE?
    

- Session ends. We are so back?
